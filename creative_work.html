                        My first published piece of fiction, "Bf 109" is a short story set in England during World War II. The story's protagonist, Technical Sergeant Tom Witkowski, is an American aircraft mechanic who watches the bombers depart from his airfield every day. Quiet and timid, Tom begins to notice new things about himself.
