                    Welcome to my website and portfolio.
                    <br><br>
                    I am a game designer and narrative designer currently living in Washington, DC. I recently graduated from American University where I received a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Games and Interactive Media. My undergraduate background is in film studies and creative writing.
                    <br><br>
                    My game design and game studies work primarily focus on the story-telling and instructive aspects of games. I'm a big science fiction fan and love role-playing and strategy games. I am also passionate about expanding the positive influence of video games and making gaming spaces more inclusive.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of making and playing games, I enjoy watching movies, cooking for myself and others, reading, and exercising.
                    <br><br>
                    The first chapter of my newest game, <i>Sapience</i>, is now in alpha! You can <a href="https://quantumcoffee.itch.io/sapience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">play it here.</a>
                    <br><br>
                    I designed and built this wesbite using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
