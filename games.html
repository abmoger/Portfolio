                        <i>Sapience</i> is my newest and biggest game yet. Made by a team of six, Sapience started as Jocelyn Wagner's and my MFA capstone project and has grown into a multi-chapter, full-length project. The alpha version of the first chapter is out now!
                        <br><br>
                        <i>Sapience</i> is a side-scroller game that takes place in the last city on Earth. With humanity all but wiped out, this city is inhabited by humanoid robots built to replace the loyal employees of the megacorporation, Sapience Inc. Far above the city floats another which is home to Sapience's board members and executives, the last humans on Earth.

                        Play as robotic siblings X3 and X4 as they explore their world, learn more about their places in it, and discover who truly controls their fates.

                        <i>Lost in Translation</i> is a prototype role-playing game (RPG) where the player is an adventurer who has just arrived in a new and unknown land and must become familiar with it, its people, and their language.

                        I created <i>Lost in Translation</i> with two other students at the American University Game Center. We built the game using Unity.

                        <i>C-Beam Survivors</i> is a shoot 'em up (shmup) game with a touch of satire. In it, the player is tasked with captaining a spaceship sent to rescue survivors from a large space battle. The game uses typical shmup mechanics and styles to subvert some tropes of the genre.
