                        This is my most recently published paper. I co-authored it with three other people and in it we explore how the indie video game <i>Spiritfarer</i> defies typical media stereotypes of older adults and how this is a timely intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic.

                        This paper, on which I am a co-author, is my first published piece in a peer-reviewed journal. In it, we discuss how games can implicitly teach their players and then use the SHMUP game, <i>Fragile Equilibrium</i>, as a case study for this concept.

                        While studying independent film and film criticism at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, I co-wrote a review of the film <i>Un Traductor</i> after attending its screening and interviewing its directors. The review was published in <i>Creative Loafing Tampa Bay</i>.

                    <p>This video essay, accompanied by a written paper, was the final project of my undergraduate film studies capstone course. In it, I make a claim for director Brad Bird's authorship by analyzing the depictions of masculinity in his films.</p>
